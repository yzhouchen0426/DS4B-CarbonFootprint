# Group-2
Final Project for Group 2 - Angie, JoJo, Yan, Britnie

**Project Proposal:**

**Delving into the sustainability of food production**

- What’s the motivation for your project?\
  We hope to visualize the environmental impact of food production and consumption, specifically looking at the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with different food 
  groups (plant starches, plant proteins, animal proteins, vegetables, fruits, and dairy). We hope to present these datasets in a way that speaks more to us as food consumers, hence we will also include a function that allows users to estimate their food GHG contributions from their diets.

- What are the questions we’d like to explore?
  - How have GHG emissions changed over time across the world?
  - What food groups are the most sustainable in terms of GHG emissions and how can individual diets affect the environment?
  - Are global emissions distributed differently between countries when looking at food consumption/production?

- What’s your target deliverable?\
  We will produce a platform that shows the food carbon footprint trend in the past few decades around the globe and the predicted trajectory of food production contribution 
  to GHG emission.
  The program will also allow users to assess their contribution to greenhouse gas emission based on their current diet.

**Update on 4/19:**

- What did you accomplish this week?
  - Created a map depicting emissions from food production using Tableau over a period of several decades and created a ranked bar chart for overall CO2 emissions by country
  - Analyzed the GHG emission of different stages of food production for 8 food groups
  - Created a function that allows users to estimate their food GHG contributions based on their diets

- What roadblocks did you face and how did you overcome them?
  - Figuring out the best method to divide up the project among the four of us -- communication and split tasks based on our interests and expertise!

- What are the tasks you plan to accomplish by Monday, April 26th?
  - Create a Tableau map depicting food GHG across the globe based on food consumptions rather than productions in different countries
  - Make an animated stacked bar chart in Tableau 
  - Perform a regression on the overall GHG emissions of the top producers and create a projected trajectory

- Do you need any more data?
  - Nope!

- Do you have any questions or need any help from us?
  - Apply streamlit functions!
